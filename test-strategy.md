## Test strategy
1. We should follow pyramid rule: Unit -> Integration -> Component & Contract
2. Unit test: >=75% coverage, preferable sensitive/complex logic
3. Integration tests: cover both sync/async interactions
4. Component tests: at least smoke tests and happy paths
5. Contract tests: optional
